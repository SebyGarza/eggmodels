### With a Bonus Introduction to our NFL Elo Model

1. Introduction

First, I want to thank you for taking the time to read this introductory blog post. While the practical uses of this website are currently minimal, it is helpful/encouraging to know that people are interested in the work we are publishing. I also want to thank my brother Sebastian for helping me build eggmodels.com. Without him, this website would be a static, colorless html table that nobody would have taken seriously. (Smaller shoutout to my sister Ana for helping with the logo design and selecting a color palette) 

The idea for a site like this was born when FiveThirtyEight stopped updating its sports models ([among others](https://www.natesilver.net/p/some-personal-news)) following major [layoffs](https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/04/disney-is-shrinking-fivethirtyeight-and-nate-silver-and-his-models-are-leaving/) at Disney earlier this year. After the models were paused, I realized that checking FiveThirtyEight's various projections had become a sort of ritual in my daily life. (Full Disclaimer: I also wrote my college essay about the website so I might be an outlier in this regard) One of my favorite things about these models was the transparency behind the numbers. It was comforting to know that the people behind these projections were confident enough not only to publish their results but also to allow others to scrutinize their assumptions and methods. This dedication to transparency allowed me to recreate a rudimentary version of the website's NFL Elo Model. I chose to "revive/update" this model first for the obvious reason that the NFL season is upon us and I need these projections for my Pick'em league. And in the same spirit of transparency that FiveThirtyEight championed, I will be sharing my methodology below for anyone who is interested in learning how the model works. (Suggestions, criticism, or praise if you're feeling kind are very much welcome)

2. Methodology

My first step in recreating FiveThirtyEight's NFL Elo Model was to read their [methodology](https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-our-nfl-predictions-work/) page. This page pretty much served as a step-by-step guide in how to recreate their results and I would recommend this article to anyone interested in a deeper dive into how the original model worked. The model presented on this page is the most basic iteration of the Elo model that was present on FiveThirtyEight. The goal is to one day implement all of the adjustments that were included in the FiveThirtyEight model (QB adjustment, rest, travel, etc.) but my original goal was to present a working version of their Elo model as a proof of concept that the model could be recreated.

My next step was to write a web scraper to read all of the NFL's games for this [season](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/games.htm) into a data frame. And by "my" next step I meant my brother's. He takes full credit for this one. After we had all of the games in a convenient location I initialized the Elo rating of each team to start the 2023 season. To find these initial Elo ratings I queried the last [update](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/nfl-elo) that FiveThirtyEight ran at the conclusion of last season and then used a simplified version of the reversion function they recommend in their methodology to set preseason ratings for the 2023 season. This is the function I used:

![Preseason Elo Adjuster](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?&space;PreseasonElo=1505*%281/3%29&plus;PastSeasonElo*%282/3%29)

After I initialized the 2023 preseason Elo Ratings, I could now calculate the win probability for each team in their season opener (and any subsequent games) using the following equation (also provided by FiveThirtyEight):

![Win Probability Function](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Pr(Win)=\frac{1}{10^\frac{-EloDiff}{400}&plus;1})

Where EloDiff is the difference in Elo Ratings between the two teams with a fixed home field adjustment of 65 Elo points. Future versions of this model will have more robust and descriptive adjustments like rest, travel, neutral site, playoffs, etc.

The next step is to create a function that updates the Elo ratings of each team after every game. This update is based on three parts: a fixed K factor which is used in all Elo models, a forecast delta that weighs results (1 for a win, 0.5 for a tie, and 0 for a loss) in accordance with the pregame expectations of the model, and lastly, a margin of victory multiplier. For now, this function was copied from the FiveThirtyEight methodology, and the code I used to combine all three looks as follows:
```
def  update_elo_ratings(pregameElo, expected_win_prob, result, pointdiff):
	K = 20
	absolute_point_diff  =  abs(homePointDiff)
	movMultiplier  =  math.log(absolute_point_diff  +  1) * (2.2  / (absolute_point_diff  *  0.001  +  2.2))
	updated_elo  =  pregameElo  +  K  * (result  -  expected_win_prob) *  movMultiplier
	return updated_elo
```
Once I programmed the various functions described above it was only a matter of looping them together accordingly after every game to update the model. Finally, to calculate the implied spread given by the Elo Model all I had to do was divide the difference in the Elo ratings of the two teams and divide this result by 25. And that's basically it! Again, if anyone has any questions or suggestions please reach out. I would love to hear from people who have used this model as I implement new models and improve this one. For now, my plan is to use this Elo functionality to simulate the season and calculate playoffs odds, Super Bowl odds, etc. which I'm sure people will enjoy as the season progresses.

Thanks again,

Eugenio
