# Two Seasons Later: Growth, Grit, and What’s Next at EggModels

## Where We Started

When I first launched EggModels prior to the 2023 NFL season, the site existed as a modest attempt to keep the spirit of FiveThirtyEight’s NFL projections alive after their models went dark. I built it for myself, really—because I needed the Elo projections for my Pick’em league and couldn’t go without them. What began as a side project quickly became something more serious.

We (me and my brother Sebastian) launched with a barebones Elo model, built from scratch based on public methodology. There was no dynamic backend (just manual updates after Monday Night Football games), no team, and no funding. EggModels was just some lines of Python code, a couple of spreadsheets, and a need to bet responsibly and often.

## Where We Are Now

Fast-forward almost two years and EggModels is no longer a one-man operation. We’ve successfully modeled **two full NFL seasons**, and I’m proud to say the model beat Vegas more often than not. We experimented with point spread distributions, playoff simulations, and tools to show you how much books screw you with parlays.

But the biggest changes have not been technical—they’ve been human.

We now have an **actual team**:
- **Jacques Morris**, de facto CTO/CIO, who has helped us expand into tennis!
- **Sebastian (Seby)**, who is now officially owning infrastructure and deployment—not just doing me favors to make the website prettier  
- **Matthew (Durie)**, swiss army knife / super utility player (RIP Oswaldo Cabrera) who gets shit done  
- **Yousif**, seasoned advisor whose market instincts have informed both modeling and trading strategy  
- **Philip (Lipe)**, our *beloved* intern (I’m not sure what the distinction is right now, but he’s the youngest member of the team) who is probably the most skilled/knowledgeable programmer on the team

Together, we’ve transitioned from just building barebones models to *deploying* them with real money, automated pipelines, and data-driven market-making in live betting environments.

## What We’re Building

EggModels is evolving from a static prediction site into a **research-first prediction market trading firm** with broader ambitions:
- **Scalable Model Infrastructure:** From NFL to tennis, and soon MLB & WNBA  
- **Market-Making Strategy:** Seeding odds, tracking fill rates, optimizing for EV  
- **Automated Deployment:** Our API integrations let us place bets in real time  
- **Community & Transparency:** We still care deeply about the openness that made FiveThirtyEight special. Our models won’t be black boxes forever

We're currently profitable. Not wildly, but enough to validate the system. More importantly, we're operating with discipline and iteration. Every bug, mispriced line, and failed hedge has taught us something.

## What’s Next

The next phase of EggModels is about **scale and stability**:
- **Wimbledon** will be our next big proving ground for tennis modeling, using a new gradient boosted tree algorithm we’re very excited about  
- **NFL 2025** will launch with updated player-level metrics and small tweaks  
- We’ll continue experimenting with **futures**, **totals**, and **live market arbitrage**, primarily on ProphetX!

And yes—if you’re reading this and thinking “I want in”—we’re listening. Whether you’re a bettor, builder, or bored quant, we’re always looking for like-minded degenerates (or Renaissance men, depending on your title preference).

Thanks again for following along.
