# Welcome to EggModels


EggModels is a sports prediction markets research project focused on inefficiencies in betting markets, with an emphasis on WTA and ATP tennis. We use data analysis, market behavior insights, and forecasting models to spot when the odds don’t add up, so you don’t have to. Our current work involves providing liquidity to other market participants to better understand how these emerging asset classes behave across varied conditions.
